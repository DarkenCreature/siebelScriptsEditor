**Changelog**

# v1.1.0 - 2022-08

- New (experimental) setting added: Get Workspaces From REST. If this checkbox is set to true, the workspaces for the connections will be fetched from the Siebel REST API, without manually writing the Workspaces setting. In order for this feature to work, an integration object has to be imported into Siebel, and that workspace should be merged into the primary branch. See documentation for more detailed instructions.
- Minor fixes in the code and in the documentation.
